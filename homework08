Beet Seed  — get the basic skills down.
In the bug tracking system (Jira), describe 3 bugs that you find on the site https://www.headhunterhairstyling.com/
Changes to the specs from the LMS: describe 2 bugs for each website or app

Beet Sprout — dive deeper into practice.
Complete the task of the previous level.
Give your own examples of bugs that may have such combinations:
Severity - Critical / Priority - Low
Severity - Minor / Priority - Highest 
(specify 2 bugs for each option)
Answer: 
Severity is Critical, but Priority is Low:
When a link on a web site that we know is not often used by users but which is currently broken.
When Load testing shows site crashing but we currently have only a small number of users.
Severity is Minor,, but Priority is Highest: 
When the text on a web page is in a different language than what it should be, than what the users know and expect.
When text is not aligned properly on a web page in a particular browser, and it even overlaps with other text or links or buttons.

About the divisions of the sections in the Test Suites (for the Monday homework), I'm not fully clear about it. So I created 2 more Test Suites and I wanted to get your feedback on which is correct, if any. In TestRails they are named as below.
